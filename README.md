# HomeworksQS-Tools
A series of tools to work with Lutron Homeworks QS.

Currently the Lutron DB is implemented to store the state of a processor. It currently works with Lutron QS version 10.x.

The Lutron Parser will parse an XML file, which is acquired directly from the processor HTTP server, into a Lutron DB instance.
